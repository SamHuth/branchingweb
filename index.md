## Websites and bootstrapping for small businesses that are serious about getting started.
Getting your business started is a hard process and worrying about websites and digital technology shouldn't put you off. Branching Web is a development studio that helps Australian small business get a step-up in the digital landscape. We are here to construct and manage websites, software and processes for the digital side of your business, so you can focus on your core product and services. We believe in creating privacy respecting technology that is built to be resilient and solve the problems in efficient ways that align with your work.
### We are Branching Web
Branching Web is an Australian development studio built for small businesses. We work closely with founders, operators, and early-stage teams to help them establish a digital presence and adopt the right technology from day one — without the bloat, the jargon, or the vendor lock-in.

We believe in building things that last. That means resilient systems without fragile dependencies, genuine respect for your customers' data, and solutions that actually solve the problem at hand. We also believe you should understand what you're using — so we take the time to educate, not just execute.
### Here's how we can help
We offer three core service areas:

**Website Design & Development** — From simple business websites to full ecommerce builds, we design and develop sites that represent your business well and perform reliably. We also offer ongoing support, bug fixes, and retainer hours for businesses that need a steady hand.

**Web Applications** — Custom dashboards, third-party integrations, data connections, and systems automation. If your business has a workflow problem that off-the-shelf software can't solve, we'll build something that can.

**Business Support** — We help new businesses get the foundational tools right: AI-assisted workflows, privacy-focused software setup (custom domain email, cloud storage, VPN, password management), SEO, analytics, and marketing infrastructure.
### What makes us different
**We're built for small business.** We're not an agency chasing enterprise contracts. Everything we do is designed around the realities of running a small business — tight budgets, fast timelines, and the need to get things right the first time.

**We take privacy seriously.** We never capture, store, or transfer your data or your customers' data unnecessarily. We'll also help you choose tools that share that philosophy.

**We build for independence.** Our goal isn't to make you dependent on us. We explain what we've built, how it works, and how to use it — so you walk away confident, not reliant.

**We're reliable.** We build systems without unnecessary fragility. And when something goes wrong, we fix it — bugs under 30 minutes are on us.

### Let's start the conversation
Getting started is straightforward. Tell us a bit about your business and what you're trying to achieve, and we'll take it from there.
