## Tech Stack

This website is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a static site generator using Nunjucks templating and Markdown for page content. Styles follow the HUG CSS methodology, structured across four layers — reset, HTML, utility, and group — keeping specificity low and styling largely classless. The Markdown Attributes plugin extends Eleventy to support custom HTML attributes directly in Markdown content.
